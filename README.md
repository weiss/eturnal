# eturnal STUN/TURN Server

[![CI](https://github.com/processone/eturnal/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)][1]

[eturnal][2] is a modern, straightforward STUN and TURN server. For
authentication, the [REST API for Access to TURN Services][3] is supported.

## Quick Test

On Linux/64, this provides a STUN service on port 3478 (UDP and TCP):

    curl https://eturnal.net/eturnal-1.8.1-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
    ETURNAL_SECRET=cryptic eturnal/bin/eturnalctl foreground

For TURN support, the system's public IP address can be
[configured](https://eturnal.net/documentation/#relay_ipv4_addr) in
`eturnal/etc/eturnal.yml` (only necessary if the system's
[hostname](https://net-tools.sourceforge.io/man/hostname.1.html) doesn't
resolve to that address), and the UDP port range
[49152](https://eturnal.net/documentation/#relay_min_port)-[65535](https://eturnal.net/documentation/#relay_max_port)
must be accessible in addition to port
[3478](https://eturnal.net/documentation/#listen). Use `eturnal/bin/eturnalctl credentials`
(in another shell) to retrieve a temporary username and password. The service
can be stopped with `Ctrl`+`c` and deleted by removing the `eturnal` directory.

## Installation

On **APT-based** Linux distributions, run:

    sudo apt install extrepo
    sudo extrepo enable eturnal
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install eturnal

On **DNF-based** Linux distributions, run:

    sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://eturnal.net/eturnal.repo
    sudo dnf install eturnal
    sudo systemctl --now enable eturnal

On **YUM-based** Linux distributions, run:

    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://eturnal.net/eturnal.repo
    sudo yum install eturnal
    sudo systemctl --now enable eturnal

On SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE systems, [distribution repositories][4]
can be used instead. On other Linux systems, the binary release can be installed
as [described][5] in the reference documentation. For Windows, an installer is
[available][6]. On other platforms, eturnal is [built from source][7].

## Configuration

The eturnal server is configured by editing the `/etc/eturnal.yml` file. This
file uses the (indentation-sensitive!) [YAML][8] format. For TURN relaying to
work, you'll have to specify the [shared authentication][3] `secret` and usually
also the `relay_ipv4_addr` option (which should be set to the server's external
IPv4 address). As an example, a minimal configuration for offering STUN and TURN
services on port 3478 (UDP and TCP) might look like this:

```yaml
eturnal:
  secret: "long-and-cryptic"     # Shared secret, CHANGE THIS.
  relay_ipv4_addr: "203.0.113.4" # The server's public IPv4 address.
  relay_ipv6_addr: "2001:db8::4" # The server's public IPv6 address (optional).
```

A more detailed, commented [example configuration][9] is shipped with the
eturnal server.

## Running eturnal

On Linux systems, the eturnal server is usually invoked by [systemd][10]. For
non-systemd platforms, an [example init script][11] is shipped in the
`etc/init.d` directory.

For controlling eturnal, the `eturnalctl` command can be used; see:

    eturnalctl help

## Logging

If eturnal was started by systemd, log files are written into the
`/var/log/eturnal` directory by default. In order to log to the [journal][12]
instead, the `log_dir` option can be set to `stdout` in the configuration file.

## Documentation

For a detailed description of eturnal's configuration options and the
`eturnalctl` tool, see the [reference documentation][13]. For notable changes
between eturnal releases, see the [change log][14].
